#### Bio
Currently a Software Engineer, working towards creating systems with extreme intelligence. As such, AI & ML are my fields. I also have aspirations in the field of Divinity, so I love my Bible.

#### Ok, enough talk
>Since I believe in using the right tool for the right job, I have been a polyglot for sometime. Below are the languages I use and the purpose for which I use them.

#### Ruby
I've been a happier person since I met the Ruby language. With frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, RSpec and tons of gems out there, I became a more productive developer in rolling out web applications.

#### JavaScript
This is the one language I can never run from. From UI/UX to NodeJS, JavaScript has always been favoured. Great mobile apps all with JavaScript mobile frameworks (RhoMobile, Phonegap, etc).

#### Python
Ooh, SciPy and NumPy held me tight to Python. A good option for Sciencific Computing.

#### C/C++
Currently strengthening myself for simulation-based applications. C/C++ will always be there. Trying my best to adhere to the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml)

#### C#, PHP, & Java
Can't believe I know this many languages. Am still fluent in these three and can roll out projects with ease. C# in particular was my favourite at a point. Hmmm, how tempting they keep becoming.

#### Octave & Matlab
I use this two for Machine Learning related stuff. I met Octave on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) when I was taking the Machine Learning course by [Prof. Andrew Ng](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ang/).
