<p>Though I appreciate blogs, it took me sometime to create mine. Knowing I've missed a lot, am here to make it up to myself. There are so many blogs out there that bring happiness into other's lives but what really is the essence of blogging. I took the liberty of "googling" first before asking anyway. A good friend of mine will always "bing" it even if he were working in Google. :D</p><p>If you are reading this, I would appreciate your comments on why you blog and the benefits you've seen so far. Hopefully, this will give someone a push to start that wonderful blog.</p><p>As an avid lover of technology, I hope to tell others about my life which include things I did, things am doing and things I want to do.</p><p>Thank you andÂ enjoy the comments.</p>
